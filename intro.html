            <p> We also used Spotify's "Million Playlist Dataset," which contains one million playlists created by Spotify users
            between January 2010 and October 2017. Each playlist in the dataset contains the following information: collaboration 
            status, name, duration, time of most recent modification, number of albums contained, number of artists, number of edits,
            number of followers, number of tracks, and playlist identification number. In addition, it also contains the list of 
            tracks for that playlist, and each track has the following information: album name, album id, artist name, artist id, 
            track name, track id, and position in the playlist.           
            </p>
            
            <p> These playlists will later be used in the evaluation of our model. To ensure that the scope of the playlist dataset is 
                of reasonable scope, we chose to sample 5,000 playlists from the million. We chose to sample playlists that contained 
                between 40 and 60 songs, since this was to most representative size from the million playlists that was large enough 
                to be used for evaluation. We also decided to sample only playlists that had at least 6 artists. We want to ensure that 
                our selected playlists are robust, and contain an appropriate range of different types of music. This minimum bound on 
                the number of artists is a useful proxy for the range of music contained within a playlist. Of all of the playlists that
                met these criteria, we conducted a simple random sample to choose 5,000 playlists. </p>

            <p> Our 5,000 playlists contain 82,056 unique songs and 21,293 unique artists. We see that the number of artists on 
            our playlists appear to be approximately normally distributed, while the number of songs in our playlists if fairly even
            across our range, with a slight decrease in frequency as we increase from 40 songs, but with a peak at 60 songs. </p>
