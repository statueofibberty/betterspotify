          <h6 class="mt-5">Presented by Jessica Bishai, Alexander Barrett, Cameron Chiarelli, and Ibby Syed <br> TF Assignment:  Mehul</h6>
          <h5 class="mt-5">Motivation</h5>

          <p><b>Our motivation for this project </b> was to take all the information that we built on in CS109 and use
            the Spotify Million Playlists Dataset and the Spotify API to create a <b>playlist extension tool</b>. A
            user should be able to use the tool to input a playlist and get song suggestions that extend that
            playlist with similar songs to enjoy, the idea being that they fit in with the playlist. </p>


          <p> We did this in a three step process - the first involved loading the dataset and downloading all of the
          features using the Spotify API (see the <a href="intro.html">EDA</a> for more details). Following this, we
            implemented a pooling model that pooled the various artist genres that were present, after which
            we vectorized the different features for every song that we had data for and used a cosine similarity matrix
            to measure the features against each other. After standardizing these, both models together gave a
            recommendation of all the possible songs that would extend the playlist. </p>

          <h5 class="mt-5">How Spotify Currently Does This</h5>

          <p><b>Spotify currently uses three different algorithms to detect your songs: </b> They first use a
            collaborative filtering model (think back to when you gave a song a "thumbs-up" on Pandora) to get pool
          together the likes of different people and create different songs within a specific category. This is called
          "Collaborative Filtering"</p>

          <p>The second type of algorithm is called <b>Natural Language Processing</b>. In a nutshell, Spotify takes a
          track's metadata and the verbiage around the internet, and assigns a score to each song based on the metadata
          and how relevant it might be to other songs.</p>

          <p>Lastly, they use <b>an audio model</b>. For songs that are up-and coming and new, Spotify will analyze
            the audio using a CNN and categorize it as based on how close it is to other songs. This means that new songs
            are able to be discovered. </p>
